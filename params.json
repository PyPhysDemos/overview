{"body":"## Overview\r\nThese are physics programming projects for undergraduate students in physics and engineering. The goal of this project is to share ideas and examples to help university students get interested in programming and computer simulations. Python is a freely available language that is easy to program and has great graphics capabilities. This site will contain background information on python as well as demonstration codes and student reports from computational physics projects.\r\n\r\n## Projects\r\nRight now, we have the following three ASU Honors Enrichment Projects with reports and python code:\r\n\r\n* “Molecular Vibrations” by Noelle Rabiah (ASU PHY 121, Summer 2011). Calculations of vibrational modes and frequencies of H2 and H2O molecules. (PDF report Molecular Vibrations, python source code molecule3.py.\r\n* “Plotting the Chaotic Motion of a Double Pendulum in Python” by Cat Terrel (ASU PHY 121, Fall 2010). Numerical integration of equations of motion of a pendulum and double pendulum. (PDF report Plotting the Chaotic Motion of a Double Pendulum in Python, python source code molecule3.py.\r\n* “The Behavior of Electric Field Vectors and Potential lines Inside a Closed Surface” by Saeed Mohamad (ASU PHY 131, Spring 2011). Calculation of electrostatic potential near a bump on a flat surface. (PDF report The Behavior of Electric Field Vectors and Potential lines Inside a Closed Surface, python source code project.py.\r\n* “Birefringence in Crystals,” by Calley Galarowicz.\r\n* “Plasmonic Waveguides,” by Lucas Bridge.\r\n* “Near-field optical microscopy,” by Joe Juliano.\r\n\r\n## Resources\r\nWe have additional information on our wiki:\r\n\r\n* Getting started with python.\r\n* Graphing with matplotlib.\r\n* Numerical arrays in numpy.\r\n* Test driven development with pyunit.\r\n* Optimizing performance in python.\r\n* Finite difference time domain evolution of E&M fields.\r\n* Writing scientific reports in LaTeX.","tagline":"A git repository for students to get started with PythonPhysicsDemos.","name":"Overview","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
