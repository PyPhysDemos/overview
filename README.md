Overview
========

PythonPhysicsDemos are physics programming projects for undergraduate students in physics and engineering. The goal of this project is to share ideas and examples to help university students get interested in programming and computer simulations. Python is a freely available language that is easy to program and has great graphics capabilities. This site will contain background information on python as well as demonstration codes and student reports from computational physics projects.
